# Calculate

God Loves You!
John 3:16

This is a simple calculator. I am still working on it to fix some stuff. The goal is to make it do advanced calculations. It would be a cool tool to help out if your in school,
but for now its a simple calculator.

This is written in C#. Using a static void to loop back to in the case of multiple problems. It utilizes the c# functions to convert to int. Cool to learn that. Focusing it's problem solving
portion of the code in a switch-case code. Still learning so expect some changes!
